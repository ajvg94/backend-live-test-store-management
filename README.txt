Please read these instructions out loud. 
When you finish, explain what you have understood about the exercise.

The goal is not necessarily to complete as much as possible but rather to see how you work and the thought process that goes into your problem-solving.

You are encouraged to talk through the exercise, communicate your decisions as you work. Doing this will let us see how you approach a problem.

Instructions:
Part I (About 20 min)
Use the database of your election, and it should be configured, up and running.
You will need to set up a database with the structure described on db_structure.png
You can make the structure by hand or use your desired database ide (i.e DBeaver).
Add the required drivers to the Nodejs-Expresssjs application you should have running, and set up the connection.

Part II (About 40 min)
You will need to set up ExpressJS to answer for full CRUD operations  (Create, GetAll, GetById, Update, Delete) using the appropriate HTTP verbs and response codes for Employees, Shop, and Employee Type.
Nice to see:
You can use an application like Postman App to test your operations and document the API.
It would be best to prepare the API to make an appropriate response to errors and inappropriate submissions.
